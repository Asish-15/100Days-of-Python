On Day 9 of my 100 Days of Python learning journey, I learned about dictionaries and nesting,
how to loop through a dictionary, and how to nest lists within dictionaries. I completed a 
coding exercise called "Grading" and wrapped up with a project titled "Secret Auction".

A dictionary in Python functions similarly to a dictionary in real life. It's a data structure
that allows us to associate a key to a value and pair the two pieces of data together.

This is how you create a dictionary in Python:

# An example dictionary
colours = {
    "apple": "red", 
    "pear": "green", 
    "banana": "yellow"
}

This is how you retrieve items from a dictionary:

print(colours["pear"])
#Will print "green"

This is how to create an empty dictionary:
my_empty_dictionary = {}

This is how you can add new items to an existing dictionary:
colours["peach"] = "pink"

This is also how you can edit an existing value in a dictionary:
colours["apple"] = "green"

This is how to loop through a dictionary and print all the keys:
for key in colours:
    print(key)

This is how to loop through a dictionary and print all the values:
for key in colours:
    print(colours[key])

Nesting a List inside a Dictionary
----------------------------------
Instead of a String value assigned to a key, we can replace it with a List. You can nest a 
List in a Dictionary like this:

my_dictionary = {
    key1: [List],
    key2: Value,
}
example:
travel_log = {
    "France": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"],
    "Germany": ["Stuttgart", "Berlin"],
}


Nesting a Dictionary inside a Dictionary
----------------------------------------
You can also nest a dictionary in a dictionary:

my_dictionary = {
    key1: Value,
    key2: {Key: Value, Key: Value},
}

example:
travel_log = {
  "France": {
    "cities_visited": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"], 
    "total_visits": 12
   },
  "Germany": {
    "cities_visited": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"], 
    "total_visits": 5
   },
}
