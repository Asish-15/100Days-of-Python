Day 7: Today, I worked on the Hangman Project. In this classic game, one player thinks of 
a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word is initially 
represented by a series of dashes, each dash corresponding to a letter in the word. As the 
guessing player suggests letters, the correct ones are revealed in their respective positions.
