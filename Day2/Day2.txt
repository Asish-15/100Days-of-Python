Today I learned about data types, type casting, subscripting, mathematical operators, 
number manipulation, operator precedence, f-strings, and assignment operators. I applied these
concepts by creating a tip calculator project, which effectively reinforced the concepts 
I learned on day two.

Errors Explored:
1) Type Error
2) Value Error

Functions I've learnt today:
1)round():
 syntax : round(num,digits)
2)type() :You can check the data type of any value or variable in python using the type() function.


DataTypes:
1.Integer
2.Float
3.String
4.Boolean

Mathematical Operators:
+  : Addition
-  : Subtraction
*  : Multiplication
/  : Division  (When you divide (/) you always get float)
// : Floor Division (When you floor divide(//) you get an int)
** : Exponentiation

PEMDAS - priority
Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction

Assignment Operators:
+=
-=
*=
/=

Flooring a Number: Removing all the decimal places using int().

f-Strings:
In Python, we can use f-strings to insert a variable or an expression into a string.

age = 12  
print(f"I am {age} years old")

Project:Tip Calculator
This is a simple program where we collect the bill information and ask the person to 
enter the tip percentage and total number of people, and then we calculate the total bill 
including the tip and slipt the bill between the people and display the personal bill amount 
to pay by the each person.
