Today I learned about Printing,Inputs, Commenting,Debugging,String Manipulation and Variables.
I had practiced few examples related to above topics.Finally today's learning ended with a small project called "Band Name Generator". 
Notes:
1. Spacing and Indentations are very Important in Python. 

Explored Errors:
1.Syntax Error
2.Indentation Error 
3.Name Error 

String Manipulations:
Concatination 

Band Name Generator:
In this program we simply take two inputs and concat it to print a single one.
