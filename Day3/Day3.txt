On Day 3 of my 100 Days of Python learning, I explored Conditional Statements, 
Logical Operators, Comparison Operators, Codeblocks, and Scope. I also completed a 
coding exercise called "Pizza Delivery" and wrapped up with a simple project, 
the "Treasure Island Game."

Comparision Operators
---------------------
>  : Greater than
<  : Less than
>= : Greater than or equal to
<= : Less than or equal to
== : Equal to
!= : Not equal to

Logical Operators
-----------------
and  
or   
not

If/else
-------
if condition:
	do this
else:
	do this


Nested if/else
--------------
if condition:
	if another condition:
		do this
	else:
		do this
else:
	do this

if/elif/else
------------
if condition:
	do this
elif another condition:
	do this
else:
	do this
