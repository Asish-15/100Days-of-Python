On Day 5 of my 100 Days of Python learning journey, I learned about For loops, 
the range function, and code blocks. I also completed two coding exercise called 
"Gauss Challenge","FizzBuzz" and worked on a small project called "Password Generator."

For Loop
--------
Loops allow us to tell the computer to repeat actions without having to write repeated code. 
If we wanted the computer to print out 1 through to 100, it would very painful to type a 
print statement for every number, or even just typing out all the numbers 1 through to 100. 
Loops allow us to create a rule and the computer can follow it to do a repeated action.

Syntax
for <variable name of each item> in <a List>:
    <do something>
    <do something else> 

For Loops with Range
--------------------
The combination of the range() function with the Python For Loop allows us to run a loop for as many times as we wish. Instead of looping through each item in a List, we can loop through a range of numbers.

Range Function
range(1, 10)

This code doesn't do anything by itself. For example, if you tried to print it, it would not give you individual numbers.

But it can be used in conjunction with For Loops. e.g.

for number in range(1, 10):
    print(number)
This will print out each of the numbers 1 - 9.
