1) Create a New IAM User:

Task your students to create a new IAM user. 
They should assign this user to a new group called "Developers" and attach the 
AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy to the group.

2) Modify an IAM Group Policy:

Ask them to modify the policy attached to an existing IAM group (e.g., "Admins") by adding 
the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy. This task will reinforce their understanding of attaching 
and detaching policies.

3) Implement Least Privilege Principle:

Have your students create a new IAM user for a specific role (e.g., a billing manager) and 
attach a custom policy that only allows this user to view billing information and nothing 
else. They should carefully craft the policy using JSON to ensure it follows the 
least privilege principle.

4) Setup a Policy for S3 Bucket Access:
Ask them to create an IAM group called "S3-Uploaders" and write a custom policy that allows 
users in this group to upload objects to a specific S3 bucket, but denies them the ability 
to delete or list objects in that bucket. They should then assign this policy to the group 
and add a test user to it.
