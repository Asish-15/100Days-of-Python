Today, as part of my 100 Days of Python learning journey, I focused on functions, 
code blocks, and while loops. I practiced defining functions, explored different types, 
and worked on some coding exercises in Reeborg's World. I wrapped up the day with an 
"Escaping the Maze" project.

----------
while something_is_true:
	#Do something repeatedly
